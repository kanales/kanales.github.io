    <h1>Planetary Planning</h1>

    
  <p>Fortunately, you have a model that is capable of calculating the fuel storage requirements, as long as you know the <strong>average distance between points</strong> on the surface of the planet.</p>
<p>Additionally, the model does not require the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic">Geodesic distance</a> (i.e. the distance betwen poles would be the diameter, and not the length of the arc).</p>
<p>You can assume that the planet is a <strong>perfect sphere</strong>. What is the distance between two points on the planet?</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> for simplicity, use the radius of the planet as the distance unit.</p>

  <summary>Hint</summary> A Monte Carlo approach for this
  problem may be helpful to get an idea of the result. To do
  this, use that the multivariate normal distribution is
  spherically symmetric: if X, Y, Z have a normal distribution
  respectively, (X, Y, Z)/|(X, Y, Z)| has uniform distribution
  over the sphere.
